ðŸ¤— AutoTrain Advanced (or simply AutoTrain), developed by Hugging Face, is a robust no-code 
platform designed to simplify the process of training state-of-the-art models across 
multiple domains: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), 
and even Tabular Data analysis. This tool leverages the powerful frameworks created by 
various teams at Hugging Face, making advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence accessible to a broader 
audience without requiring deep technical expertise.

## Who should use AutoTrain?

AutoTrain is the perfect tool for anyone eager to dive into the world of machine learning 
without getting bogged down by the complexities of model training. 
Whether you're a business professional, researcher, educator, or hobbyist, 
AutoTrain offers the simplicity of a no-code interface while still providing the 
capabilities necessary to develop sophisticated models tailored to your unique datasets.

AutoTrain is for anyone who wants to train a state-of-the-art model for a NLP, CV, Speech or even Tabular task,
but doesn't want to spend time on the technical details of training a model. 

Our mission is to democratize machine learning technology, ensuring it is not only 
accessible to data scientists and ML engineers but also to those without a technical 
background. If you're looking to harness the power of AI for your projects, 
AutoTrain is your answer.


## How to use AutoTrain?

We offer several ways to use AutoTrain:

- No code users can use `AutoTrain Advanced` by creating a new space with AutoTrain Docker image: 
[Click here](https://huggingface.co/login?next=/spaces/autotrain-projects/autotrain-advanced?duplicate=true) to create AutoTrain Space.
Remember to keep your space private and ensure it is equipped with the necessary hardware resources (GPU) for optimal performance.

- If you prefer a more hands-on approach, AutoTrain Advanced can also be run locally 
through its intuitive UI or accessed via the Python API provided in the autotrain-advanced 
package. This flexibility allows developers to integrate AutoTrain capabilities directly 
into their projects, customize workflows, and enhance their toolsets with advanced machine 
learning functionalities.


By bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical usability, 
AutoTrain Advanced empowers users to achieve remarkable results in AI without the need 
for extensive programming knowledge. Start your journey with AutoTrain today and unlock 
the potential of machine learning for your projects!
