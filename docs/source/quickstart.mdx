# üöÄ Quickstart Guide for Local Training with Neural-Forge-Ai  

This guide is for **local installation and usage** of **Neural-Forge-Ai**.  
If you want to use **Neural-Forge-Ai on Hugging Face Spaces**, please refer to the  
‚û°Ô∏è *[Neural-Forge-Ai on Hugging Face Spaces](#)* section.

## üìå Installing Neural-Forge-Ai  

You can install **Neural-Forge-Ai** using pip:  

```bash
$ pip install neural-forge-ai
üí° Recommended: It is advised to install neural-forge-ai in a virtual environment
to avoid package conflicts with other dependencies.

‚ö† Note: Neural-Forge-Ai does not install pytorch, torchaudio, torchvision, or other large dependencies.
You will need to install them separately.

üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up a Virtual Environment
We recommend using Conda for managing dependencies efficiently:

bash
Copy
Edit
$ conda create -n neuralforge python=3.10
$ conda activate neuralforge
$ pip install neural-forge-ai
$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
$ conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-12.1.0" cuda-nvcc
$ conda install xformers -c xformers
$ python -m nltk.downloader punkt
$ pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation  # if you want to use flash-attn
$ pip install deepspeed  # if you want to use DeepSpeed
üñ•Ô∏è Running Neural-Forge-Ai UI (User Interface)
To launch the Neural-Forge-Ai UI locally, use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
$ export HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_write_token
$ neural-forge app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
This will start the UI on:
‚û° http://127.0.0.1:8000

‚ö° Using Neural-Forge-Ai Command Line Interface (CLI)
You can also use the CLI commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
$ export HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_write_token
$ neural-forge --help
This will display the available CLI commands:

bash
Copy
Edit
usage: neural-forge <command> [<args>]

positional arguments:
{
    app,
    llm,
    setup,
    api,
    text-classification,
    text-regression,
    image-classification,
    tabular,
    spacerunner,
    seq2seq,
    token-classification
}
    
    commands

options:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
  --version, -v         Display Neural-Forge-Ai version
  --config CONFIG       Optional configuration file

For more information about a command, run: `neural-forge <command> --help`
üî• Key CLI Commands for Model Training
For best performance, we recommend using the neural-forge --config CONFIG_FILE command for training.

Below are the main CLI commands that users will find useful:

Command	Description
app	Start the Neural-Forge-Ai UI
llm	Train a large language model (LLM)
text-classification	Train a text classification model
text-regression	Train a text regression model
image-classification	Train an image classification model
tabular	Train a tabular data model
spacerunner	Train a custom model using SpaceRunner
seq2seq	Train a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model
token-classification	Train a token classification model
üí° Recommended Approach:
Instead of using individual commands, we recommend using:

bash
Copy
Edit
neural-forge --config CONFIG_FILE
This ensures seamless model training without requiring manual configuration of each task.
